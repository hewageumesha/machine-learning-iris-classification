# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

Welcome to my **first Machine Learning project**!  
In this project, I built a model that predicts the **species of an Iris flower** using its physical measurements.

This project helped me understand the **complete machine learning workflow**, from data exploration to model saving.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify Iris flowers into one of the following categories:

- 🌼 Iris Setosa  
- 🌼 Iris Versicolor  
- 🌼 Iris Virginica  

A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier is used to perform this classification task.

## 📊 Dataset Details

- Dataset: Iris Dataset (R. A. Fisher, 1936)
- Total samples: 150
- Number of classes: 3
- Features used:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)

This dataset is widely used as a beginner-friendly benchmark in machine learning.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Data split:
  - 80% Training
  - 20% Testing

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

### ✅ Results
- Model Accuracy: **~97%**
- The classifier performs well across all three Iris species.

---

## 💾 Saved Model

The trained model is saved using Python’s `pickle` module:

---

## SVM.pickle

This allows the model to be reused without retraining.

# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This is my first Machine Learning project. The goal of this project is to predict the species of an Iris flower using machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Overview

The model classifies Iris flowers into three categories:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for this task.

---

## Dataset

- Iris dataset by R. A. Fisher (1936)
- Total samples: 150
- Features:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## Machine Learning Model

- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Train/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

---

## Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

### Results
- Accuracy: approximately 97%

---

## Saved Model

The trained model is saved using pickle as:

SVM.pickle
